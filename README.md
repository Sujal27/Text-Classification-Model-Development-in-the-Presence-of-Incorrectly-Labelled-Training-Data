# Text-Classification-Model-Development-in-the-Presence-of-Incorrectly-Labelled-Training-Data

- Orchestrated a dataset of 3,000 text samples, manually categorizing each while developing techniques to address erroneous data. Utilized SQL for advanced data handling in text classification project, significantly enhancing model accuracy through effective management.
- Developed a cost-sensitive text classifier to deal with was the imbalanced distribution of samples among different classes.
- The accuracy of the model is estimated to be 96.93% and 78.20% on the training and test sets, respectively.
